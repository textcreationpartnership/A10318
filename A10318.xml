            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Sir, touching the truth of thoſe matters you deſire to know: Firſt, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your ſelfe for certaine, there is but one truth; from which, whoſoeuer obſtinatly ſwarueth muſt needes be a lyar, &amp; ſo not of God, but of the Diuell the father of lies. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to knowe the truth, you can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of none more certaine; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him, who is truth himſelfe, who calleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <hi>via, veritas, &amp; vita: the way, truth, &amp; life.</hi> A way by grace; truth by infallible direction; &amp; life by fruition of his glory, that is Chriſt: him, if you follow the true way, you ſhall not walke a-ſtray; him, the light and fountaine of truth, if you
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:15985:15"/>
chiefly reſpect, you ſhall not erre, nor be ouer-whelmed in darkneſſe, and ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here want the life of grace, without which the ſoule cannot liue: nor ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of Gods glory, without which the ſoule liueth in euerlaſting death: without which life of grace here, &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry there, better it had bin neuer to haue enioyed this mortal &amp; tranſitory life. For <hi>what profiteth it a man</hi> (ſaith that euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting truth) <hi>if he winne the wholeworld, and looſe his owne ſoule?</hi> The beauty of which ſoule of man created by God, whilſt it remayneth in ſtate of grace, is ſo great, as framed to the likeneſſe of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; the dignity ſo excellent, as being fellow and coheire with Chriſt: and the price of ſuch value, as redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with his pretious bloud; which beauty of mans ſoule, is ſoiled, blotted, quite loſt, yea become like vnto the olde and crooked moſt vglie ſerpent the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell by ſin; ignorance, &amp; forgetfulneſſe; to be briefe for want of knowledge, and following of the truth, which is Chriſt, who ſaid he that followeth me, walketh not in darkneſſe, but ſhal haue the light
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15985:15"/>
of life. Aſſure your ſelfe then (my good Sir) that it is the ſweete motion of Gods holy ſpirit that in clineth your deſire to know the truth, which is of ſuch inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible force, that it ſtayeth it ſelfe in God only, I meane as the finall, and chiefe end of truth. For wine may be ſtrong, women faire, Princes mighty, <hi>Sed omnia vincit veritas, But truth ouercommeth all thinges.</hi> Enquire then of Chriſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible truth of thoſe thinges you ſtand in doubt, and you ſhall be ſure neuer to miſſe the way: ſo that you ſo enquire that you follow him with perſeuerance to the end, which is obteyned by Gods grace in perfect humility: without ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, preſumption, or truſt in our ſelues as of our ſelues, but working with Gods grace our owne ſaluation, chiefly repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and ſtaying our ſelues in the helpe and mercies of God: and ſo in matters of faith, yea and good workes alſo, a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I meane, may be in ſure hope, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence neuer to miſſe the way. I haue you will ſaye, enquired thus of Chriſt, but I finde diuers profeſſors of Chriſt, quite differing a ſunder in moſt weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

matters of high miſteries of Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Sacraments, Ceremonies and of euerlaſting Saluation, and yet all parties glorie of the truth. How may I then an vnlerned man diſcerne the light of the truth, from amongſt ſo many monſtrous cloudes of darknes. Hear therefore what Chriſt ſaith, the truth that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not fail, wel conſider, I ſay, the rule he ſetteth downe to know the truth, from the diſſembled cloake of trueth, which is pernitious falſehood, and deceitfull flattery. Theſe be his words, <hi>Many ſhal come in my name, &amp; ſay, I am Chriſt, &amp; ſhall deceiue many:</hi>

Another ſort of men called <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> who raigne at <hi>Geneua</hi> &amp; here eſpecially in <hi>England,</hi> affirme Chriſt and the truth of the goſpel to be only with them, theſe men ſay only faith iuſtifieth, &amp; leadeth to Saluation, they deny Chriſtes Bleſſed Body and Blood to be really, &amp; ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, truly preſent in the moſt Bleſſed Sacrament of the Altar: Theſe men deny prayer for the Faithfull departed, inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Saintes and the like.

So that this communion of theirs, being quite contrarye to Chriſtes ordinance to receiue it is moſt horrible, and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinne. And as by a worthye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueing the bleſſed Sacrament a man is

For receiuing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion as the <hi>Diabolicall Samaritanes,</hi> the miniſters therof do raiſe vp an Altar as it were againſt the true Altar of God, which God euer ſo abhorred &amp; terribly puniſhed: ſo the receauers of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (I ſay) make a publike profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the deniall of the B.

Likewiſe not to come to Maſſe euery Sonday, &amp; Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day (if a man can conueniently) is dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sinne. So not to receaue once a yeere, &amp; that about Eaſter, the moſt Bleſſed Sacrament, is deadlie Sinne. Likewiſe all ſeruile workes and laboures (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a man haue great neede, or that

thinges ſtand in danger of looſing) be forbidden on one of thoſe daies vnder paine of ſinne. Thoſe that in all lawfull and honeſt things of great importance diſobay their Parents, Maſters, Kings, Princes and lawful Superiours offend deadly. But if father or mother, maſter or miſtres, King or prince, or whoſoeuer commaund me any vnlawfull thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods law, or the law of the holy Catholike Church I may then in no ſorte obay them, no not to die for it: but in that caſe we may ſay with Saint <hi>Peter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> when the officers, and Iudges would haue had him to haue broken Gods law, &amp; to haue beene an obedient and good ſubiecte (as heretikes tearme it) to his Prince, <hi>Nay</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Peter we muſt obey</hi>

                  <hi>God rather than men.</hi> And yet in all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; honeſt thinges he exhorteth, and commaundeth vs to obaye Princes &amp; Rulers, which we ought to doe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we offende. Moreouer thoſe that giue not euery one their due (eſpecially in a matter of importance) and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe their tenants, or vniuſtly wrong their poore neighbours offende deadly.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:15985:74"/>
Likewiſe thoſe that vniuſtly kil, by word or deede; or conſent to death, or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of others, or in any ſort procure their owne or other mens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> death vniuſtlye of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend deadly: though the lawfull Iudge &amp; Magiſtrate may cauſe malefactors to be executed, &amp; if they do it without malice, and iuſtly, they doe God good ſeruice. Likewiſe thoſe that ſpeake, and vſe craft, &amp; vniuſt dealing deceiuing their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in great matters offende deadly. So likewiſe doe alvſerers yea though they take but the ſtatute, and are bounde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paine of deadly ſinne to make reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, otherwiſe the Preiſt cannot giue them abſolution. Thoſe likewiſe be cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vſerers that ſell dearer then the market will giue in ready money, for that they forbeare their mony; yet if they ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine any hindraunce by bearing their mony, they may iuſtly take ſo much as therby they be hindered, but no more. Here I lament the ſtate of manye mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants &amp; petty fogging lawiers, for it is very da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous: As for Simony, as buying and ſelling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpirituall benefices, and ſuch matter; it is now ſo common amongſt

the new Biſhoppes and miniſters, that becauſe God taketh not preſent ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance vpon them, but ſtaieth for their amendement, they thinke it is almoſt no ſinne, but they ſhall finde it one day moſt heauy; for it is moſt deadly, and if euer God ſend a good and Catholike time heere in our Countrie they maie chaunce bee called to a reckoning for their honeſt dealing, vnleſſe they ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely amende and become friendes, as they haue beene enimies to the Church, which I beſeech God they may to his glorie, and their owne Saluation. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all fornication, and vnlawfull deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with anie (ſaue onely that lawfull knowledge betweene man and wife) is a deadly ſinne, and that betwixt man &amp; wife alſo ought to bee in honeſt ſort for the auoiding of fornication, and for procreation of children, otherwiſe it is ſinne. Here likewiſe all diſhoneſt tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of our ſelues or others, and all vnſeemlye lookes, all vnhoneſt ſpeches, and vnlawfull deſires, with a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of hart to that fleſhly ſin of leachery is forbidden, vnder paine of deadlye
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:15985:75"/>
ſinne, which and manye other ſecret ſinnes (not fit heere to bee named) are rather in Confeſſion to bee forbidden than heere to be opened. But I am af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid <hi>England</hi> at this day (were it but only in ſuch matters) is in a miſerable ſtate for want of Confeſſion. For young folkes (alas) be not taught what is ſinne, nor how to auoid it. Likewiſe all drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, gluttons, eſpecially thoſe that breake Lent, Fridayes, Satterdayes, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber daies, and other Eues, &amp; holy faſting dayes (if they be able to faſt, or haue not ſome lawfull impediment) common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offende deadly, and ſo doe all perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious liars to other mens hurt, ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deres, backbiters, ſtealers, or vniuſt receauers of other mens goodes, theſe and manye others hidden, and open finnes that I cannot ſtand to reckon be deadlie againſt Gods holy Lawe and Commaundiments, and muſt bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and that to a lawfull Preiſt, that hath Iuriſdiction, and authority: for it is not the leaſt of thoſe deadlye ſinnes by me reckoned (with many mo which time ſerueth me not to reckon)
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:15985:76"/>
but they deſerue euerlaſting death. And becauſe the breach of Gods commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement procureth death to the ſoule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the breach of the Princes comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement (in capitall matters) procureth death of the body, therefore they be called deadly.</p>

The whole man in Paradiſe was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by eating with mouthe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruite. Thus then Chriſt cured the whole man againſt the Diuell per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading <hi>Eue</hi> to diſobey God, hee ſent the Archangell <hi>Gabriell</hi> to perſwade the B. virgin Marye to conſent to his will, againſt the Apple-tree hee planted the Croſſe of our redemption.

But he vrgeth how the holy Fathers call the bleſſed Sacrament a figure; yea true, but not a figure alone, or a bare figure, but ſuch a figure as Chriſt is a figure of his fathers ſubſtance, and yet his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in deed: ſo the ſacrament is a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Chriſt, and yet Chriſt in deede: Ther can be no more groſſe or blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conceipt, then to thinke the word of God like the worde of man.

               <p>But the holy Fathers, which heretikes ſeldome reade, or if they doe little vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand or not beleiue them, when theſe bleſſed men (I ſay) ſpake of ſpirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing, as oft they doe, they not onlye teach vs the great and ſtedfaſt faith, &amp; earneſt deſire, we ought to haue to this bleſſed Sacrament, but the due prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration we ought to make worthely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſame, which is by innocent life and pure conſcience, remaining in Chriſt by feruent loue &amp; charity, which is ſpiritually to receiue Chriſt, that ſo he may remaine in vs &amp; we in him, &amp; with
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:15985:119"/>
this preparation, if a man could not come to receiue ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tally the bleſſed Sacrament al the dayes of his life, yet no doubt he ſhould be ſaued, for that thus ſpiritually he eateth Chriſt. In like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the holy Doctors (namely Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>) tearme this B Sacrament a ſigne or figure which we deny not, for euery Sacrament is a figure of ſigne, otherwiſe it could not be a Sacrament, but in that the heretikes call it a bare ſigne as it were, or an only figure and ſigne, that by the holy Fathers doctrine we vtterlie denye, and by Gods worde proue the contrary. For the Sacrament of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar is both a ſigne or figure, and yet the thing it ſelfe alſo which it ſignifieth, or figureth: as for example you ſee a loafe of bread ſtand before the bakers ſhopp to be ſould, it is both a ſigne that bread is there to be ſould, and yet very bread it ſelfe: ſo the Bleſſed Sacrament of the Altar, is a ſigne of Chriſtes body, and yet his very body it ſelfe. How a ſigne of Chriſts body, will you ſay? Marry a figure and ſigne of Chriſtes body, dead, broken, crucified, in an other quality,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:15985:120"/>
then we receiue him in the bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. For in the bleſſed Sacrament wee receiue Chriſtes bodye, though a very true and naturall bodye: yet not ſubiect to thoſe alterations and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties our bodies bee: and therfore wee receiue him with al (if I might ſo tearme it which is verelie naturall) a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall bodye, an impaſſible bodye, a glorified body, though in very deede before his Paſſion alſo hee gaue to his Diſciples the very ſame bodye we nowe in the ſame Sacrament receiue, giuing his owne body in his owne handes to his Diſciples by his mighty diuine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er vnited to that body, to which power nothing is impoſſible. So that (as ſaith a late famous writer) <hi>wee verely teach &amp; beleene the figure and the truth to ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; the ſupper of our Lord to bee the ſigne of Chriſts body, and to bee his owne bodye; the weaker parte is the ſigne, the greater is the truth:</hi> but both doth not only ſtand together in one Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but furthermore the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of euery Sacrament of Chriſt is to haue both, that is to ſay to haue one
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:15985:120"/>
certaine truth and one certaine ſigne of the ſame truth, the truth is hidden vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſigne, the ſigne is witneſſe of the truth, which once being declared you ſhall ſe the vaine doctrine of the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> The ſignes and miracles Chriſt wrought outwardly, were tokens of his Godhead hidden from our eyes, likewiſe the ſupper of Chriſt, is both a ſigne of his body &amp; alſo his true body; a ſigne outwardly and the true bodye inwardly: a ſigne by the ſound of words when it is firſt made, and a truth by the inwarde working of the holy Ghoſt by conſecration. So that Chriſt (inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to leaue certaine holy miſteries vn to his Church, thereby to conuey vnto her the fruit of his Paſſion and death, as well for regard of his owne ſelf in whoſe perſon two natures were vnited, as for regard of vs who conſiſt of bodye and ſoule) made the ſaid holy Sacraments to bee of a double ſorte and nature, ſo that the one parte thereof might appeare to the ſences, the other ſhould lye priuye and onlie bee ſeene by faith.

               <p>When <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſay Chriſt gaue a figure or ſigne of his body, the <hi>Proteſtant Grammarians</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand a Rhetoricall figure as <hi>Meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymia</hi>

For as vnder the viſible fleſhe of Chriſt his Godhead lay priuy, but yet was truely preſent, and had aſſumpted his fleſh into one perſon: euen ſo vnder the viſible forme of bread the fleſhe of Chriſt is really preſent in the holy myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,

Thus the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes reaſon, let him that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſence, iudge who goeth nearer the truth of the Goſpell in preſenting and ſhewing Chriſtes death, the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> that hath but bread, or the Catholicke that hath the very body. So that as you may partly gather by that which I haue already ſaid, the neceſſary meane of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary remembrance of his death con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the reall preſence of him that died.

               <p>Wee may ſee nowe by this what error they fall into, who call Chriſtes ſupper only a figure of his bodye, yea who aſſigne the bodye and bloud of Chriſt to our ſoules, and bread and

wine to our bodies, whereas there is no ſubſtance left of bread and wine, but euen our bodies feede vpon Chriſtes body as <hi>Ireneus, Cyrillus,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> haue ſaid, that as our ſoules be fed with grace: ſo by eating Chriſtes fleſh our bodies may riſe to glorie. Hauing then ſuch firme authorities, of Chriſt, the Apoſtles, and the moſt auncient, and learned Fathers, wee litle acount of the wordes of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who haue rather brought Chriſts ſupper in contempt by bare tearmes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by any ſound authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or aleadging of ſcriptures. As for <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uins</hi> ſupper, nothing is wrought therein, becauſe bread and wine in it remaineth ſtill, neither is any newe thing wrought in Chriſt impaſsible, or poſsibly can be, whom they ſay they eate by faith: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their ſupper is nothing but bread. In Chriſts ſupper, wee teach the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of bread and wine to be made the ſubſtance of Chriſts Body &amp; Bloud, and that is the true worke made in the ſupper of Chriſt, where the mutable creatures are turned into the immutable ſubſtance of Chriſt. Which worke ſince
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:15985:126"/>
the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> deny (babble what they will) they teach nothing to be wrought in the ſupper of Chriſt: yet this ſhift the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> haue to couer their falſhood, becauſe they ſee the Scriptures, Fathers, and Councels ſo plaine for Chriſts reall preſence, therefore they vſe tearmes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmooth of putting on Chriſt in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and of eating his body &amp; bloud, to the ende, their deniall of the thing it ſelf may be leſſe of the vnlearned eſpied. For it is to be noted, that to make it eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to vs, that Chriſt gaue vs his very body, &amp; not a figure therof, or the effect of the grace of his godhead only; he ſaid not I giue my owne ſelfe (as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay we receiue him) which may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of his diuinity as well as huma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nity in one perſon; and ſo (<hi>ſelfe</hi>) maketh for the receiuing of Chriſt by grace &amp; ſpirit only. But Ieſus foreſeing the drifts of Satan, &amp; what hereſies woulde ariſe, named expreſlie how he gaue his body couered vnder the formes of bread &amp; wine, which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we touch, we touch his very body; for euen as kiſsing the hoſe vnder which the Kings knee is contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:15985:126"/>
we are ſaid to kiſſe the kings knee: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo in touching the accidents of bread &amp; wine, we touch the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt vnder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For (as I ſaid) as S. <hi>Tho.</hi> touching Chriſts fleſh, confeſſed him to be God, becauſe the godhead lay hid in that fleſh: right ſo whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we touch with teeth &amp; mouth the forme of bread in the holy miſteries, we confes that we touch therby the fleſh that lieth hid vnder that forme. Therfore to ſpeak of his B. body nowe riſen againe, which after a ſpiritual &amp; ſupernatural maner &amp; ſort (though re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ally &amp; truly the very body of Chriſt) we receiue in the B.

                     <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 2.</note> Therefore when Chriſt ſaid <hi>This is my body which is giuen for you.</hi> I am bound to beleeue that his bodye is neither without ſoule nor godhead, for elſe it were not truly ſaid, it is giuen ſor vs if it vvere not profitable to vs. Thus you ſee that I beleeue all the wordes of Chriſt together, and that you not doing ſo, are (without you repent) certaine to bee condemned ſor not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing theſe words. <hi>Take eate this is my
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:15985:141"/>
body,</hi> you will ſay you beleeue theſe wordes, yet not carrially but ſpiritually, as it is meete for Chriſts wordes to bee beleeued. O Sir, he that aſsigneth a meane how he wil beleeue Chriſts words in that very fact ſheweth himſelfe not to beleeue them. For beliefe inuenteth nothing of his owne, but followeth the authority of God that ſpeaketh. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in deede that Chriſts wordes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be carnall, as you take carnall words for foule &amp; groſſe meanings, but I ſee it to be a very cleane and pure meaning, that the moſt pure ſubſtance of the fleſh of Chriſt ſhould be giuen vnder the forme of bread, to the end it may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of vs, and the chiefe and the cleaneſt thing we vſe to eate is bread: to giue therefore the chiefe and moſt healthfull fleſh in the worlde to be eaten vnder rhe forme of the pureſt eatable thing, is a very pure and cleane worke, farre from carnality. You will ſay it is more pure if it be rather beleeued to be eaten only of the hart of man by faith and ſpirit, then by mouth and body. I anſwere that it is no pure eating of a corporall
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:15985:141"/>
thing, which taketh away the truth of corporall eating. Againe both waies of eating are better then one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alone: I beleeue his reall fleſh to be eaten with hart and mouth, to be eaten with body &amp; mind, to be eaten in deed &amp; in faith. Here faileth your beliefe, becauſe of two true things you beleeue but one, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you diſcredit. To be ſhort, let vs i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine him that beleeueth the real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſts body and bloud vnder the formes of bread and wine, to ſtande before the ſeat of Gods iudgment, and that Chriſt asketh him, why he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and worſhip his body and bloud vnder the formes of bread and wine: may he not well anſwere in this vviſe? I beleeued ſo, and did ſo becauſe your Maieſtie taking bread and hauing bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it doubted not to ſay. <hi>This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> which wordes all my forefathers vnderſtoode to be ſpoken properly, and to be true as they ſounded, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the commandement of my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates I a dored your bodye vnder the forme of bread. If CHRIST reply that hee had Preachers whoe taught
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:15985:142"/>
him otherwiſe, &amp; cried to him to beware leaſt he committed Idolatry: Firſt that obiection might not bee made to any man, that died aboue 80. yeares paſt, becauſe no Preacher taught publikely any ſuch doctrine. Secondly if ſo much were ſaid to one of our time, he might anſwere that hee had moe forefathers and moe Preachets, and thoſe much more auncient and more honeſt men, who required him to beleeue Chriſts wordes, and to worſhip the body of his maker. Well nowe wee are come to the point, all the Catholickes haue preached with one accorde, that it is the true body of Chriſt, and the Goſpell witneſſeth that CHRIST ſaid. <hi>This is my body:</hi> here is the worde of God, and the tradition and preaching of man ioyned togither, I aske whether it bee poſsible for CHRIST (vvhoe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of vs nothing ſo earneſtly as be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If you ſay, his eyes tould him it was not the body of Chriſt, hee vvill anſvvere, that for the reuerence he bare to the worde of God, hee denied the ſenſible inſtruction of his eyes, as giuing more credit to Chriſt, then to himſelfe, is that a fault?

But on the other ſide if Chriſt call one of them before him, who denieth his reall preſence, and aske him why hee did not beleeue the Sacrament of the Altar, to bee the body of Chriſt what will he anſwere for himſelfe? will he ſay Sir, I beleeued your body to ſitt at the right hand of God the father, and therefore that your body was not in the Prieſts hande?

Neither is it my purpoſe to anſwere here all hereticall obiections; neither to make any long diſcourſe of ſo vnſpeakable a matter, for to giue or ſet downe the full doctrine hereof would require and fill (as I ſaid) many and lardge bookes, which already of moſt learned men bee written.

into ſuch high miſteries to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend Gods mighty workes by reaſon. For what is man to compare as it were himſelfe with God, to think to containe him whome heauen and earth cannot holde? for what is one man in reſpect of ſo many men, or what be al men in reſpect of God? Man is (as it were) a mite, like a vanity, a puff of winde; God is mighty, incomprehenſible, yea great in the leaſt thinges, without variance or inconſtancie, at a becke of whoſe finger the very heauens, and earth do trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and quake, the deapth of whoſe mightie workes we cannot reach vnto, no not in the leaſt thinges, or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures wee daylie ſee here before our eyes. Who can number the ſtarres or giue a iuſt accompt of their ſwift courſe, without going one iote out of order from the beginning of the worlde to this day? the very herbes, plantes, and trees wee ſee doe daily grow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. Who is ſo wiſe that can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne or ſay nowe at this very inſtant I perceaue the increaſe? Againe vvhen they bee as it vvere deade in vvinter
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:15985:155"/>
who can ſay they ſhal ſo flouriſh in ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but he that hath experience? Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine ſome man brought vp in ſome caue vnder the earth, neuer ſeeing light nor conuerſing with men, If one ſhould come vnto him on a ſodain, and diſcourſe with him of collours blacke and greene, and the like, tell him of the ſpring the courſe of the ſonne, moone and ſtarres, would he not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and think them aboue reaſon, till he ſawe and perceaued them as we doe? If then theſe thinges ſo familiar to vs ſeeme ſo admirable to thoſe that be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed to ſee them, or if we our ſelues cannot giue a reaſon to the depth of the leaſt things, can wee thinke to comprehend God in the greateſt? would we haue God ſo litle, that he cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed our reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?

This Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as I haue ſaid ofte before) is farre aboue reaſon, but ſubmitting our reaſon to true faith it greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth our merite. For as ſaith Saint <hi>Gregory, Gods worke is not merueilous if it bee comprehended in reaſon, neither hath faith merite where mannes reaſon giueth experience.</hi> The chiefe thing then of this bleſſed Sacrament is Chriſtes bodye and bloud, vvith the vvoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull graces and gifts of God beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein, commonly called the effects and fruits thereof: vvhich that wee may not vvith <hi>Iudas</hi> receaue to our damnation, but vvith Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to our riſing againe and endleſſe Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I beſeech our LORD that wee may bee armed vvith true and firme faith, pure and innocent life, feruent

loue and charitye, that as for our ſinnes for wante of theſe vertues it now many yeares hath by Gods Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and wrath beene taken from vs, to our vnſpeakeable loſſe and the continuall griefe of all good men: So by renewing theſe vertues againe in vs, and by amending our liues, it once againe by Gods ſpeciall grace may be reſtored to vs, to the honour and glorie of his holy name, to the confuſion of the Diuel and all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and to our vnſpeakable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and endleſſe ioy in heauen: that whereas here vvee nowe truly receaue CHRIST in this vnſpeakeable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, there wee may bee fedde and enioy his preſence in that endleſſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, vvhich hee onr LORD IESVS graunt who bee bleſſed for euer. But yet moreouer one thing is to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered touching the manner of recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this bleſſed Sacrament, vvhich is, that although CHRIST gaue this bleſſed Sacrament vnto his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles vnder both kindes, that is, his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud apart, and although both
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:15985:163"/>
Biſhops and Prieſts, as oft as they cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate Maſſe according to Chriſts inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, are to receaue vnder both kinds: yet the holy Church, vpon moſt weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſideration giueth the lay people but only one kind (that is the holy Hoſt Chriſts body) and that which the Prieſt or Clarke giueth them after in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or in a glaſſe, is but wine to waſhe their mouthes, leſt any of the holy Hoſt ſhoulde be left behinde, or ſticke in the mouth; neither are lay perſons in this receauing vnder one kinde defrauded of the bloude of Chriſt, nay they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue in that one kinde as fully and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Chriſt, as the Prieſt (that may liuely repreſent Chriſts Paſſion, and ſhedding of his bloud, as the publicke Miniſter of the Church) receaueth both. For though his body be conſecrated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and his bloud apart in miſtery, to ſignifie the effuſion thereof, and his death in his Paſſion, yet Chriſt is not deuided, and therefore whoſoeuer recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his bodye, likewiſe receaueth hys bloud, as being nowe inſeperably ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together. For although through
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:15985:163"/>
the force of the words of the Sacrament by conſecration, the body and bloud be ſeuerally preſent vpon the Altar, yet by the concommitance, naturall, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable vnion betwixt them, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily followeth, that where the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is, there alſo is the bloud, and where the bloud, there likewiſe the body: Yet ſor feare of inconueniences, that might chaunce (if the common people ſhould receaue vnder both kindes) yea and for conſeruation of vniformity in receauing this B. Sacrament (the knot of peace in all perſons, and places of the worlde) and for other iuſt cauſes, the holy Church, who hath to diſpoſe of this B.

For he that ſaid, the 6. of S. <hi>Iohn. Vnleſſe you eate the fleſh of the ſonne of man, &amp; drink his bloud, you ſhall not haue life in you,</hi> hee likewiſe in the ſame chapter ſaide, <hi>He that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this bread ſhall liue for euer,</hi> yea he

our Sauiour likewiſe as appeareth the 24. Chap. of S. <hi>Luke</hi> gaue it two of his diſciples vnder one kind when he tooke bread, bleſſed, and gaue to them, and their eyes were opened and they knewe him, which was that bread (as manye learned fathers vnderſtand) that bread of life (I ſaye) that came downe from heauen Chriſt himſelf his bleſſed body, which would GOD the heretickes in true faith and charitye would diſpoſe them ſelues with vs, yea and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtes to receaue: then no doubt their eyes would bee opened to ſee and bee partakers of the truthe, whoſe eyes (alas) infidelity, pride, and other ſins haue ſo blinded, that whereas at firſt ſome of them began to contend for the cup the bloud of our Lord: in breaking vnity &amp; charity, in departing from the church, they haue of Gods hea uy iuſtice and iudgement (who in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinat ſinners ſuffereth one ſinne to bee the puniſhment of an other) loſt both body, bloud, the price of their redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; al.

The firſt of theſe lower orders is called the Oſtiary,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:15985:169"/>
that is the dore keeper, that hath by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that office giuen him (which the keyes the Biſhop giueth him doth beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) power to keepe, and ſhutte the Church dores to keepe out heretickes and infidels, and preſerue encloſed from prophane handes the holy veſtures, and ſacred veſſels of Chriſt. The ſecond or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is the Reader, that by the booke which the Biſhoppe giueth him may reade holy leſſons of holy Writ in the Church. The third order is called an Exorciſt, which hath power giuen him to expell and caſt out Diuels, not by witchcraft and ſuperſtition, as South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers, Conjurers, and Witches haue, openly and ſecretly calling vpon the Di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uell: but by the worde of God and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority giuen him by the Church. The fourth of the leſſer orders is called an Acolite that may bring in cruets wine, &amp; water to the altar to ſerue the Prieſt, cloathes, candels, incenſe, lights, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things neceſſary. And theſe 4. or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders be degrees toward the 3. higher or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Prieſthood, which declare what a ſoueraigne thing it is, and that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:15985:169"/>
ought raſhly, or preſumptuouſly to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to ſo high a dignity without due conſideration, preparation, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. For if in the olde lawe the Prieſts had their Leuits and other inferior mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to ſerue them in their bloudy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, how much more conuenient is it in this lawe of grace, that Prieſtes which ſerue the liuing God with the pure vnbloudy ſacrifice of Chriſt at the Altar, haue due Miniſters &amp; ſeruitors, which none but they ſo authorized can properly exerciſe. Theſe inferiour or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Primitiue church it ſeemeth were better knowne &amp; practiſed with more ſolemnity, then nowe they bee, though in Cathedrall Churches to this day in Catholicke countries they be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly vſed, neither without them can any take Prieſthoode without ſinne.</p>

The ſecond and chiefe fruit and effecte thereof is, that it forgiueth all ſuch ſinnes we could not remember in Confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as appeareth by the words likwiſe of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> who ſaith. <hi>If the ſick be in ſinne, it ſhal be forgiuen him.</hi> Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ſinnes then and defects, yea &amp; grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too (if we could not remember the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) bee herein forgiuen.

Theſe ſeauen Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments (I ſay) haue I briefly touched, and the grounds thereof, prouing eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one by the very and expreſſe worde of God, tradition, and generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the whole Church, which may ſuffice any ſimple or vnlearned ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to know the truth, for in behalfe of ſuch like eſpecially I haue taken theſe paines, with as much plaineneſſe, and ſimple ſtile as poſſibly I might in ſo high matters: neither was it my intent to giue any full doctrine of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but only to touch the principall groundes. If any deſire morefull and large diſcourſe, I referre him to the bookes of the learned, wherein he ſhall finde many treatiſes in all tongues of ſome one Sacrament or other, and of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery matter almoſt, or altogither at large, by me here briefly touched, and ſo paſſed ouer. But becauſe the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be for the moſt part the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall points of our religion next to the B. Trinity, Incarnation, and Paſsion, thoſe
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:15985:191"/>
briefly for your ſake (becauſe you deſire to know the truth for your ſaluation) I thought good to touch. For as God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty by Chriſt Ieſus our meritorious Sauiour is the chiefe efficient cauſe of our juſtification: So his Sacraments be the ordinary meanes, and inſtrumentall cauſes whereby a man in receauing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (if he be well diſpoſed by the grace of God, and put no let of his part) of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and childe of the Diuell, is made a iuſt man and the childe of God, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and rayſed vp againe (in Baptiſme eſpecially) from Orjginall ſin by Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> as he was vitiated and fell from originall iuſtice by <hi>Adam</hi> our firſt father. And though God worketh commonly his grace in matter diſpoſed, yet he it is that ſo preuenteth, diſpoſeth, and freely giueth the grace firſt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a mans ſelfe. So that when man firſt receaueth Gods grace, whereby <hi>ex impio fit iuſtus,</hi> that is, <hi>of a wicked man,</hi> and veſſell of perdition, <hi>hee is made a iuſt man,</hi> which is called juſtification, and the firſt grace preuenting a man: that (I ſay) by grace of God is wrought of
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:15985:191"/>
his meere loue and goodneſſe, vvithout any worke, meritte, or deſert of man, for otherwiſe grace ſhould not be grace which is firſt giuen without any deſert or merit of our part, wherby wee bee ſo made iuſt. And hereof the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith as from Gods ovvne mouth <hi>Quia dilexite, ideo attraxite miſerans,</hi>

and that for the merites, and prayers of Saints (though they be departed) God giueth many good gifts, and graces to his ſeruantes; you ſhall finde it in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places of holye Scripture: as for example in the olde Teſtament almoſt in euery booke, you ſhall finde hovve God for his ſeruauntes <hi>Abraham, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and for <hi>Dauid</hi> his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes ſake and the like, ſpared and did not puniſhe his people vvhen they deſerued it, but gaue them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites for their ſakes longe before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.

And although <hi>Peter, Iohn,</hi> and others of the Apoſtles went to the Temple of the Iewes, after Chriſts Aſcention, they did that law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, becauſe she lawe of Chriſt then being not ſo manifeſtly knowne, nor his faith and Goſpell ſpread through the worlde, the lawe of <hi>Moyſes</hi> was by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to be buried with honour, yea and the Apoſtles went chiefly thither, by their preaching, doctrine, and miracles to confound the obſtinate Iewes, and plant Chriſt, &amp; the truth in their harts; in which caſe, a learned Doctor of the Catholike Church that is to make a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike ſermon, or to conuert, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found an hereticall preacher, might goe to Church: yea ſome holde, that for ſome meere temporal reſpect; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to beare the Princes ſword, or his cuſhen, or the like, one might ſo waite of his Lord and Maſter to Church, ſo it be knowne to all men that that temporall action or office, is only the cauſe of his ſo doing, and ſo one neither pray, nor

Secondly this matter was talked of, and debated by certaine great learned men,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:15985:269"/>
at the counſell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and was founde moſt vnlawfull, both by the law of God and the Church, &amp; therefore no power on earth, no not the Pope can diſpence with any, to goe to the heretikes church, no more then he can diſpence with any to kill, ſteale, comit fornication, or the like, neither was it needeful to make any new canon, or decree of this matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in former generall councelles, yt was euer holden vnlawfull yea an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe canon of the Apoſtles, forbiddeth al Chriſtians to goe to heretiks churches or ſeruice, much leſſe to receiue with them, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with them in their Sacraments: If any ſay <hi>Cardinall Allen</hi> thought it not ſuch great ſinne, to goe to heretiks church, it is moſt falſe, &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, as his letters and writinges wel vnderſtood; yea his life and death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, and as the liues and deaths of his ſchollars which (if I may ſo terme it bee <hi>vere ſignu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Apoſtolatus ſui</hi>) make moſt manifeſt to the world, and he that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it lawful to goe to Church of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demneth well neere a hundred of B. Martirs in our daies, that might haue
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:15985:269"/>
liued if they once would haue yeeldeth to haue gone to Church. Thirdly the Pope himſelf and all learned diuines of our time vtterly deny it in any ſort to be lawfull: and no doubt his holines, if in any ſorte, it could haue bene tollerated of his commiſſeration, and fatherly pitty of our affliction, would moſt willingly haue diſpenced with vs, ſurely the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike father the Pope, alone his iudge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ought to ſatiſfi any true Catholik Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in the world. Fourthly goeing to heretikes Church is moſt dangerous, for feare of infection: can a man touch pitch and it not defile him? can he lye by a Serpent, and ſhe not ſting him? then then may he conuers with an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retik, much and be not infected or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with him; and therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth vs to flie the heretik man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his hereſie creepeth as the ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ker, it hath bene noted in great learned men, that in reading of heretikes bookes haue bin thereby inclyning to hereſie: how much more dangerous then is it, for lay perſons; Yea ſimple vnlearned men to heare their voice, in ſermons, prayers,
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:15985:270"/>
and the like, wherefore heretiks bookes alſo vnder paine of excommunication be forbidden, to all to be read. For feare of infection, vnleſſe they haue lawfull authority or faculty graunted them. Fiftly as wee read in the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories, true Chriſtians euermore ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred the Churches, conuenticles and companies of heretiks, yea Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Euangeliſt</hi> would not bath himſelf, where <hi>Cerinthus</hi> the enemie of the truth had bene before, leſt the bath ſhould fal vppon his head, and exhorteth vs not to ſalute the heretike which wee ought not to do in any ſort to fauour his hereſi, though to wynne heretiks to God and true religion. The church in this time permitteth vs to eat drinck, and traffick with heretiks and ſchiſmatiks in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall matters only, as our B. Sauiour, and his Apoſtles conuerſed, eat and drank with ſinners, to winne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his fathers kingdome; yea to conuerſe with heretiks was ſo odious &amp; a thing ſo well knowne in the primitiue church, to be vnlawful that the people would not ſay Amen, or abide in the Church, whilſt the <hi>Arrian</hi>
                  <pb n="509" facs="tcp:15985:270"/>
Biſhop was amongſt them: nay (that which is ſtrange) the very childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, made a conſcience to play with the ball, (with out expiacion before) that ranne vnder the heretiks horſes feete, what ſhould I ſay bleſſed <hi>Martirs</hi> of old, yea tender Virgins and Women, accounted it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe then very denial of Chriſt, who ſaid <hi>Hee that denyeth mee before men, I will deny him before my father in heauen</hi> either to goe to churches of heretiks or temples of Idolaters, which be in effect one; For as Idolaters worſhip the workes of their handes, ſo do heretiks their fond opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and imaginations, and Idolatry a great deale worſe then that of the genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. If theſe bleſſed Saints of old (I ſay) would but haue yeelded to the tyme, in but once putting vp the fingar to the wicked demaunds of the perſecutors, to haue gone to their churches, and ſeruice, then had, wee wanted many glorious Martirs in heauen, which thoſe ſharpe tymes of perſecution moſt fruitfully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford vs. Sixtly this diſſimulation in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent at heretiks ſeruice, is ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, and offenſiue, to the infirme and
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:15985:271"/>
weak in faith, inducing other to ſinne, &amp; do the like, which ſinne of ſcandall, is one of the greateſt and moſt generall in the world, and ſhal be moſt ſeuerely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; againſt which Chriſt thundereth that moſt terrible woe, affirming it were better one with a mill-ſtone about his neck, were caſt into the ſea, then to ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliſe one of ſuch litleweaklings in chriſt and religion. Whereuppon the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle affirmed, he would neuer eat fleſh, rather then offend his weake Brother. Yea old <hi>Eleazarus</hi> a <hi>Iew,</hi> before Chriſt (which may be a confuſion, to many Chriſtians) would rather ſuffer death, then but only ſeeme to do againſt the law, for feare of drawing weaklinges, and younglinges, to do the ſame. Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenthly and laſt (for it is my purpoſe to be briefe) and referre you to more large and learned ſubſtantiall treatiſes, writen of this matter, in goeing to heretikes Churches, or being thus preſent at their prayers, Sacramentes, or ſeruice in any place, conuenticle, or congregation of theirs be a man neuer ſo Catholick in minde, yet in ſo doing he becommeth a
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:15985:271"/>
ſchiſmatike, &amp; excommunicate perſon, which is a thing more terrible then the two edged ſword or any torment in this life. For thereby a man is cut from God, Chriſt, and all the Sacraments, prayers, &amp; merits of Saints in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers &amp; good deedes, of all good men in earth, &amp; ſo is expoſed to the Deuill, and damnation.

Church ſhall goe into euerlaſting fier, prepared for the Deuill, &amp; his Angells, a terrible token whereof God ſhewed, yea euen in this life of ſchiſmatiks, as <hi>Chore, Dathan &amp; Abiron,</hi> that were of the ſame religion <hi>Moyſes</hi> was, &amp; yet becauſe they deuided themſelues, from <hi>Moyſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring ſacrifice of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues &amp; not being lawfully called thereunto, fire conſumed them from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; their adhere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. Yea the earth ſwallowed them downé quick to hell, &amp; therefore S. Auguſtine <hi>biddeth feare nothing ſo much as diuiſion, &amp; ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that is ſchiſme; for what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> ſchiſme,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:15985:272"/>
but a cutting of, and diuiſion from the whole: ſo that ſuch Chriſtians as in all points beleeue, as the church doth, and yet in their action do contrary to their beliefe (as ſuch diſſemblers do, that for feare or other temporall reſpect, as heere in England goe to church) ſuch proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee ſchiſmatiks, ſo called becauſe by their ſeperation they not only deuide, &amp; cut of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues quite from Gods church but alſo teare in ſunder the miſticall body of Chriſt (which is one) worſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſouldiers, that caſt lott vppon his veſture, not cutting it a ſunder: ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiks then firſt bee deuided in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, pretending one thing in body, &amp; thinking another in minde: indeede if wee in ſubſtance conſiſted only of ſoule, the caſe were altered, but ſeeing wee conſiſt both of body and ſoule God, (as I ſaid before out of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) requireth action and confeſſion of body; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of hart to concurre togeather, as both in the end ſhall haue reward or iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gement together, ſecondly ſchiſme is ſo grieuous in Gods ſight, becauſe it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſheth charity, without which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:15985:272"/>
can pleaſe God: for charity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of vnity, which ſchiſme by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration &amp; diuiſion quite taketh away, God almighty then which in himſelfe is one, as all things proceede from him by vnity (as the roote and liuely perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall fountaine) ſo muſt they tend and haue reflection to him againe by chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in vnity, wherein <hi>whoſoeuer gathereth not with Chriſt he ſcattereth,</hi> as hee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth hereupon; it commeth according to the Apoſtles doctrine, that we be all one body in Chriſts holy Catholicke Church, from which whoſoeuer is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided by ſchiſme, he cannot haue life of Grace and ſaluation from Chriſt the head, as being a deuided member from his miſticall body; euen as any member of our body dieth, we ſee that is deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from our naturall body. Therefore S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> right worthely exhorteth to feare nothing ſo much as ſeperation (that is ſchiſme) whereby wee looſe the grace of God, al merits of prayers, good works, life, and ſaluation, this ought to appale our Schiſmatiks, if they had any feeling or feare of God, but theſe of our

as of God, Chriſt, &amp; the <hi>Bleſſed Trinity</hi> heretikes quite differ from the catholike Church, as alſo in that great matter of iuſtification by faith and good works in Chriſt Ieſus, which the holy Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles ſo diuinely teacheth, whoſe meaning S. <hi>Iames</hi> after ſo perfectly explaneth, yea S. <hi>Peter</hi> the Prince of the Apoſtles exhorting vs by good works to <hi>make our vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuer &amp; ſtable forwarneth Chriſtians to take heede how they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his brother <hi>Paul</hi> who according to that hye diuine wiſedome of God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him, wrote many thinges hard to be vnderſtood, <hi>which the vnlearned &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable depraue as the reſt of the Scriptures to their owne deſtruction</hi> ſaith he; good Lord do not theſe wauering vnſtable heretiks of our tyme (as S. <hi>Peter</hi> right worthely termeth them) neuer long contynuing in one opinion but full, with themſelues and others, of ſects and diſſentions do they not moſt peruerſly and corruptly interpret chiefly this holy Apoſtles Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles againſt the true matter of iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, confounding faith &amp; good works, yea affirming faith alone to iuſtifie,
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:15985:295"/>
which is a very diabolicall faith, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming man hath no true iuſtice in him, with many abſurdities and hereſies. As about the merrits not only of our good workes, and the Saints in heauen which they affirme to be none, but about the merrittes of IESVS Chriſt himſelfe: the like abſurdities they hold about pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination free will, the Sacraments, inuocation of Saints, prayer for the dead, images, pilgrimage, pardons, faſting, prayers, and euery point all moſt of the Catholike Churches faith. And be theſe of the Church of God who hold not one ſounde opinion almoſt of God, Heauen, Hell, Purgatory, nor of the Church of God it ſelf militant heere on earth, ſparing neither the ſoules of the glorious S. in heauen, nor their bodies and ſacred reliques heere in earth, but digge them out of their tombes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume them with fire, and caſt their aſhes to be diſperſed in the water, and the winde to trye (perhappes with the old heathens) whether they ſhall riſe againe at the laſt day, and can wee make theſe men (or rather monſters) members with theſe
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:15985:296"/>
glorious Saints in heauen, as of the ſame Church whoſe faith they deſpiſe, whoſe good manners they ſo little followe and regard, and whoſe very bodies and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes they ſo racke, teare, and ranſacke here o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n earth. If we can of chalke make cheeſe, make the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> white, or firmely conjoyne braſſe and earth togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then perhaps wee may joyne Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes and Proteſtants in one Church and make them beautifull and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Gods ſight, and not before; no, no, theſe two as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> farre differ in Gods ſight, in his grace and fauour, as the other things doe in nature, and much more: Heretikes that deuide their loue from the whole Church of God, deuide their liues, deuide their faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, can be no more acceptable of God (the naturall head and ſpouſe of his one only Church) then it could be pleaſing to the natural mother by <hi>Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue the child deuided, who choſe rather to leaue it in the euill womans keeping: euen ſo God our true father will haue vs one (as he is one) in vnity of true faith and religion in his Church,
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:15985:296"/>
or elſe we cannot be true children with him in his houſe, which is one and not deuided. Hereupon my firſt ground<note place="margin">1.</note> is this, that neither <hi>Lutherans, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, Puritanes,</hi> nor any other ſecte whatſoeuer in the worlde, diſſenting from the common knowne Catholicke and Apoſtolike Romane Church, can bee members of the true Church of GOD, nor canpoſsibly bee ſaued; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as God is one, ſo his true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke ſpouſe the Church (as one wife of one husband) is one, one in faith and religion, and that in euery point and article, <hi>tuam vnus Dominus, vna fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, vnum Baptiſma,</hi> and <hi>without true faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> which is only the one Catholicke faith, and Church, vvithout vvhich vvhoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyeth, ſhall moſt certainly periſh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſtingly, as all did bodely out of <hi>Noes</hi> Arke, teſtemonies hereof bee abundant, the Prophettes, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and all the whole courſe of Scriptures and Fathers, ſo expounding them, namely holy <hi>Athanaſius</hi> vvhoſe Creede is receiued of the vniuerſall Church
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:15985:297"/>
of God, which Church is rightly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>vna Columba mea, amica mea,</hi> of Chriſt her ſpouſe, <hi>viz: my only doue, my darling,</hi> one, choſen out from amongſt a thouſand: all heretickes then diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thus from Catholickes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelues can neuer be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Gods Church, as long as they remayne in this ſtate, deuided from that one, and only Catholicke Church. Secondly, if wee looke inwardly into the moſt eſſentiall parts of our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith and religion, you ſhall finde them chiefly to differ from vs therein, for if they were but incertaine indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent matters left for learned men to vſe their opinions and judgment in, and not articles of faith defined out of holy Scripture by the Church of God, (the true keeper and expoſitor of Scripture) wherein they differ from vs, they vvere tollerable; but they differ from vs, not only in leſſe articles, but in many, and the chiefeſt, ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, intrinſicall parts and articles of faith, the leaſt vvhereof, euery one vnder paine of damnation, is bounde
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:15985:297"/>
to keepe pure, and vndefiled. Nowe <hi>Buny</hi> in his <hi>Pacification</hi> pag. an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eight, following ſome of his fellowes, <hi>Bullinger, Muſculus,</hi> and the like (vvho finding themſelues miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably intangled vvith this queſtion of the Church) deuiſed certaine prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and foundations of faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vvhoſoeuer agreed, they ſhould be accounted all members of one church, theſe <hi>Buny</hi> imitating (of his bounty) is ſo liberall towards vs poore Papiſts; inſomuch that more then once hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that in ſubſtance of religion wee and they agree, and therefore that wee bee all one members of one Catholicke, and Apoſtolicke Church, and blameth his fellowe Miniſters; that very raſhly, and inconſideratly they reject Papiſts from the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the true church. For (ſaith he) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we confes the papiſtical Church, to be the true Catholike and Apoſtolicke Church (whereof wee are members no leſſe then the Papiſts) wee caſt our ſelues into a great difficulty to finde any other Carholicke and Apoſtolicke
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:15985:298"/>
Church, which being planted firſt of the Apoſtles, hath alwaies continued to our time, wherein wee as members may be ingraffed, which if wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finde or performe, then are vvee conſtrayned to confeſſe our Church to be more new and later then the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church, thus farre <hi>Buny:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, you may ſee what ſhifts heretikes are driuen to, that woulde make the vvorlde to beleeue wee differ in ſmall, or no ſubſtantiall partes of teligion that ſo by ſeeming to creepe into one Church vvith vs (though vvanting altogither the vertue, and for the moſt part the true faith of members of the Church) yet at leaſtwiſe they may couer themſelues vnder the bare title of the true Church; the more to couer their badde dealinges, and to deceaue the ſimple. But what front<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe brazen faces of Proteſtants bee theſe to affirme that their ſects agree with the CATHOLICKE CHVRCH not only of all former times, and of all Nations in the vvorlde, but alſo that they bee not contrary to the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:15985:298"/>
Church at this day. Let vs then briefly conſider all the eſſentiall, or ſubſtantiall parts of the Church of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time and of this age vvhich is all one, and let vs ſee in vvhat one principall point of faith or gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Heretickes agree vvith vs. Firſt they haue inſtituted another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment or politique gouernment of the Church quite contrary to that of the true CATHOLICKE CHVRCH, for in ſteede of the Biſhoppe of Rome (generall and only chiefe Paſtor of the vvhole Church) they haue made temporall Princes heads of the Church, whereby as for example here in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, making firſt a Man, then a Boy, and nowe a Woman heade of the Church, they chaunge religion as oft as Princes, vvhether the Prince bee <hi>Lutheran, Adiaphoriſt,</hi> halfe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke, as King <hi>Henry</hi> was; <hi>Zwingli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> (as his daughter is ſaid to be) <hi>trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, Arrian</hi> as another may be, or <hi>Turke</hi> as perhaps the other may be; if to bee ſupreame head of the Church bee ſo annexed to the Crowne as a matter of
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:15985:299"/>
inheritaunce as our Engliſh Diuines nowe of late haue made it, yea and that by Gods lawe wee bee bounde to obey them in ſpirituall matters, then by this diuinity, euery new King may coyne a newe religion, quite contrary to his predeceſſor; and all good and holy. Whereas to <hi>Pster</hi> and his ſucceſſors, Chriſts Vicar, by Chriſts ordinance <hi>made head of his Church, to keepe vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of faith to the worldes end:</hi> in the ſame is certainly promiſed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of all heretickes in the vvorlde, that his faith (euer one) ſhall not faile, which promiſe Chriſt hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto kept with his Church and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Paſtor, and ſhall doe to the worlds end, let me ſee now vvhether any he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticke in the vvorlde, can, or dare auouch ſo much for his ſect, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as vvee dare boldlye affirme, that CHIST his prayer to his father for our true Church is heard, <hi>Ego rogaui pro te</hi> Petre <hi>vt non deficiat fides tua.</hi> Well this ordinance of CHRIST (of ſuch importaunce for the gouernment of the Church) heretickes haue altered,
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:15985:299"/>
and you ſee howe it prooueth vvith them; <hi>Quot capita, tot fides, tot ſenten tiae.</hi> Secondly, they haue quite taken away Prieſthood, and Sacrifice, and haue induced a newe miniſtery altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vvhich is a matter of ſo greate importance, that it altereth the whole lawe. Thirdly, of ſeauen Sacraments they haue taken away quite ſix, is this a ſmall point thinke you; which in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte taketh from vs, the chiefe effects of CHRISTS Paſſion and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inſomuch that a true Catholicke rather ought ro ſuffer death, then deny the leaſt Sacrament, but <hi>Buny</hi> and ſuch like can ſwallowe vppe any thing. Fourthly, they haue quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed certaine articles out of the very Apoſtles Creede, as for example, vvhereas according to the Scriptures, we are taught to beleeue how CHRIST <hi>dsſcended into hell:</hi> if the Apoſtles creede bee not ſubſtantiall parts of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, wherein wee are taught chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what to beleeue (vvhereas this v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the faith Apoſtolicke is one chiefe foundation of chriſtian religion)
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:15985:300"/>
then nothing at all is materiall or of ſubſtance to bee beleeued: Fiftly, as I ſayde before, touching predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on iuſtification, free will, rewarde of good workes, <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> haue coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſuch newe opinions (beſides olde hereſies which they holdt about ſome of them) as were neuer heard of before. Sixtly, they deny authority to many of the canonicall Scripturs. Seauenthly, (as I alſo touched before) of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of GOD, of the bleſſed <hi>Trinity</hi> of three perſons and vnity of one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, of the death of Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, heretiks haue deuiſed mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous horrible opinions and blaſphea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, horrible for not only Chriſtians but very <hi>Turks</hi> to thinke or ſpeake of, &amp; be theſe the fellowes that make not a Church a new of their owne but amend the old, do they differ from vs I ſay but in ſmall indifferent matters; Fie vppon ſuch palpable lyes, fie vppon ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency, that euer men that would be accounted reaſonable creatures, can haue faces to auouch ſuch abſurdities, to goe about to huddle vp ſuch groſſe
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:15985:300"/>
inconueniences all in one bowgett; and moſt miſerable and weake ſenceles and vngratious be thoſe men that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue ſuch lying Maſters, that vnder ſuch prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of piety, or rather the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of open impiety bring in ſuch ſects of perdition, to the ſubuerſion of many ſeely ſoules. Thirdly as I heere<note place="margin">3.</note> before haue noted, in taking away ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall prieſthood &amp; ſacrifice, they haue quite in a moſt eſſentiall point altered the whole law of Chriſt; for according to the Apoſtles doctrine and <hi>Haeb. 7. 5 12. tranſlate enim ſacerdotio neceſſe eſt vt &amp; legis tranſlatio fiat</hi> ſo that ſay <hi>Bullinger Buny</hi> or any other <hi>Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts</hi> in the world what they wil they muſt goe ſeeke a new Church, from the Catholike Church to maſke themſelues in: for heere poſſibly can be no hold for them, whoſe prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood they haue taken away, whoſe ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice they haue aboleſhed, which prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood &amp; ſacrifice is one great part of the chiefe forme and ſubſtance of the whole law of Chriſt, for heereby we be taught the law of God, heereby we be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and conſerued in the law of God,
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:15985:301"/>
heereby we chiefely acknowledge god, heereby wee bee ſeuered from falſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers and worſhippers of GOD, and heareby we truly worſhippe, honour, and adore the moſt high and only God, and with ſuch ſupreme worſhippe, as is due to no creatuer neither in heauen nor earth, ſo that you ſee what here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes hane done, in not only altering, but leauing no externall prieſthood nor Sacrifice at all: Firſt they by quite altering the law of Chriſt haue made them a new Church of their owne to dwell in more then euer GOD made; they haue alſo abrogated all good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and orderly gouernment, both to learne how to beleeue, and how to liue and conſerue themſelues in the grace of GOD, and openly to be knowne for his ſeruants, yea in taking away Sacrifice the chiefe ſeruice of GOD, they fruſtrate in themſelues the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt, the fruits of his Paſso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and make an open gappe to all ſinne, infidelity and plaine <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> as by lamentable experience wee ſee at this day, wherſoeuer <hi>Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts</hi> haue planted
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:15985:301"/>
their fift Goſpell, that quite ſupplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the true Church of Chriſt into the malignant church of <hi>Sathan.</hi> Fourthly heretiks truly acknowledging now by force the <hi>Romaine</hi> church for the true Catholik Church iuſtly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne themſelues as beeing iuſtly cenſured and condemned for blaſpheamous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate heretiks of the ſame which if ſhe be the true Church (as they ſay deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to bee accounted members of the ſame) then is ſhe not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to her ſelfe as being guided with the holy Ghoſt as Chriſt promiſed his true Church euer ſhould be, &amp; thus you ſee the Apoſtles words verefied in heretiks who be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by their owne iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (ſaith he &amp; therefore biddes vs. <hi>Flee them after the firſt and ſecond correction,</hi> to ſuch Chriſt ſhall iuſtly ſay at the laſt day. <hi>Ex ore tuo te iudico ſerue nequam,</hi> who for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and miſbeleeuing beeing openly condemned accurſed &amp; quite cut of by exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication by his ſpouſe &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her (who yet beeing vrged they durſt not but confeſſe her to be the true Church) yet ſtil they diſobayed her, to their owne
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:15985:302"/>
perdition and of their deceiued follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, like to thoſe proude deuils who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſt to be the Sonne of God, yet giuen ouer in deſperate obſtinacy to a reprobate ſence, ſtill by their ſleights &amp; tentations, draw as many as they can from God, blaſpheaming his holy name though to their owne paine euer, and greater damnation, heerevppon it is ſo hard to heare of a learned chiefe heretike truly conuerted, if he haue long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued obſtinate, becauſe he ſinneth of malice, and commonly in the beginning eſpecially againſt his owne conſcience, and ſo damned by his owne iudgement, in the end, is by Gods iuſt iudgement quite blinde in ſoule &amp; vnderſtanding, and ſo being become obdurate or har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened in hart, is giuen ouer <hi>in reprobum ſenſum.</hi> Thus you ſee how heretiks make an argument againſt themſelues in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting themſelues members of that Church which they rebelliouſly diſobay which by Chriſts commandement they are commanded to heare &amp; follow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to whoſe precept from which they be runnegates &amp; plaine Apoſtates &amp; of
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:15985:302"/>
the ſame Church be publikly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Fiftly it yrketh me to finde any ſo feeble or weake if they be but once well inclined to the true Catholike Church, as once to thinke that the heretiks of our tyme can be in any ſort members of the ſame, to yeeld reaſons for the diſproofe of ſo manifeſt an vntruth, ſeemeth to mee as needeles as to proue that the Diuell is alyar or that the Sunne ſhyneth at the noone day: For beſides (as I touched before) the Heretikes of our time one ſect or other, either quite deny or els damnably erre in the moſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall and ſubſtantiall articles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith and religion, yea ſo farre and deepely that <hi>Turkes</hi> may as well yea and<note place="margin">Except that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks beare the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, &amp;c</note> better (though both be naught) be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as Chriſtian Catholiks and for me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of Gods Church as they. For the heretiks of this tyme rayſe vp from hell, al old hereſies (whereof <hi>Turciſine</hi> firſt aroſe) for the moſt part that haue bene from Chriſts time to this day, &amp; ſuch as many hundred yeeres agone haue bene condemned by the general conſent of al Chriſtendome &amp; now knitting altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:15985:303"/>
in one fardell with a number moe of their owne and the deuils new deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing they make rather a generall apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy denying al things in effect that good is, then an hereſie from the Church ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the hye way to the Diuell and <hi>Antichrist,</hi> learning yet this leſſon of falſe <hi>Mahomet</hi> their grandeſire, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte al ſects and religions, that in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wordes confeſſe GOD, to be of their Church or to be ſaued and, ſo by the Diuells drift endeauour to their power, to ſend all the world packing to Hell. Butlett vs ſuppoſe (which would GOD it were true) that <hi>Protestants</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from the Catholike Church, but in ſome one point; or the leaſt article of our faith now in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at this day. As for example inuocation of Saints, or the vſe of images, yet I ſay &amp; am able plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to proue, that for the obſtinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall of the leſſe of theſe points, or any ſuch like they ſhould quite cut themſelues off from the vnity of Chriſts Catholike Church; which we are bound by Chriſts owne word, &amp; by the inſtruction of our creede to heare &amp; beleeue, &amp; becauſe as
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:15985:303"/>
there is but one faith &amp; Church, ſo but one truth therein, which is plaine and ſimple and cannot be intermedled with any lye, therfore whatſoeuer this church propoſeth as matter of truth &amp; faith to be beleeued. I am bound to beleeue it or els I diſcredit her for a lying Church &amp; ſo not the Church of Chriſt which is truth, ſo that deny the Churches truth and beliefe in one point, deny her in al, and the miſ beliefe and obſtinate gayne ſaying againſt one article of faith, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth one an heretike, and ſo offender againſt the whole, for God is truth and wholly in euery part of truth, ſo that to deny any receiued truth of the Church, which is matter of faith, is to offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the whole, inſomuch that S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith <hi>qui totam legem ſeruauerit offender it autem in vno factus est, omnium reus,</hi> he that keepeth the whole law &amp; offendeth in one point is guiltie of al, now the true Church of GOD eight hundred yeeres agone condemned image breakers, (for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple) quite cutting them off from the corps &amp; vnity of the Church commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to al as a matter of faith that good
